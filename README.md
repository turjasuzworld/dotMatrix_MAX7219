This library and project has been developed using some free source codes from TI, CCS and created by me. This is still under development.
You can interface MAX7219 dotmatrix with MSP430G2553 (tested as of now) but, with slight modification. I am not sending stream of data directly thru the DATA
rather individually the displays are clocked separately.

>> THIS LIB IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT & TESTING <<
=======
THIS IS THE DEV BRANCH. AFTER TESTING WILL BE INTEGRATED TO MASTER
